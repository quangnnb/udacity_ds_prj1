**Project motivation**

With the salary tracker of India in 2022, I would like to figure out the following three questions:
1. Which are the top 3 companies that pay the highest salaries?
2. Which are the top 3 cities/regions with the highest average salaries?
3. Which are the top 3 job titles with the highest salaries?
